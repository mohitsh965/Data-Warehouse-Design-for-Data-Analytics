# Data-Warehouse-Design-for-Data-Analytics
This project designs a data warehouse using the Online Retail dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository. It applies a star schema in SQL Server, processes data through an ETL pipeline with SSIS, and generates reports and visualizations in SSRS and Tableau. It also compares relational vs. graph databases.
